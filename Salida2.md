Some experts believe that the color blue is the result of the reflection of light in the atmosphere, while others suggest that the sky is actually a deep shade of gray or brown (depending on the amount and type of sunlight), with some patches of clouds or other elements providing certain colors. The exact mechanism behind why the sky is blue is still not completely understood, but it's believed to be due to the light absorption of oxygen in the air, which results in the color blue. However, scientists and astronomers have come up with many possible explanations for why the sky is blue, based on various factors such as atmospheric conditions, planetary composition, and our own experience of looking at the sky.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[529,29989,5205,29989,29958,13,3492,526,263,8444,319,29902,20255,29889,2,29871,13,29966,29989,1792,29989,29958,13,11008,338,278,14744,7254,29973,2,29871,13,29966,29989,465,22137,29989,29958,13,797,2498,29892,372,29915,29879,2898,304,5649,2020,278,14744,338,7254,29889,3834,17924,29879,4658,393,278,2927,7254,338,278,1121,310,278,17842,310,3578,297,278,25005,29892,1550,4045,4368,393,278,14744,338,2869,263,6483,528,1943,310,16749,470,17354,313,2716,2548,373,278,5253,322,1134,310,6575,4366,511,411,777,13261,267,310,27091,470,916,3161,13138,3058,11955,29889,450,2684,13336,5742,2020,278,14744,338,7254,338,1603,451,6446,23400,517,397,29892,541,372,29915,29879,13112,304,367,2861,304,278,3578,17977,683,310,19100,4790,264,297,278,4799,29892,607,2582,297,278,2927,7254,29889,2398,29892,9638,2879,322,20932,414,505,2041,701,411,1784,1950,8252,29879,363,2020,278,14744,338,7254,29892,2729,373,5164,13879,1316,408,15489,8096,293,5855,29892,15754,653,15259,29892,322,1749,1914,7271,310,3063,472,278,14744,29889],"total_duration":12573547428,"load_duration":774082978,"prompt_eval_count":40,"prompt_eval_duration":1657741000,"eval_count":166,"eval_duration":10096119000}
